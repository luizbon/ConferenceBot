However questions remain around concept and implementation, especially when you start to compare how we've built systems in the past, and what serverlessoffers us now. Is Serverless the future, or just the emperor's new clothes?\n\nThis talk will very briefly introduce serverless computing, but will then dive into some of the questions that aren't always asked in conjunction with this technology. Topics will include:\n\n* How does your attitude to security change?\n\n* Is it easier, or harder, to create reliable, resilient systems? \n\n* Do patterns like Circuit breakers and connection pools make sense any more?\n\n* Is vendor lock-in a problem?\n\n* Is serverless computing only for microservice architectures?\n\n* Which problems fit serverless computing?\n\nBy the end of the talk you should have a firm grasp of what serverless computing really can offer, cut through some of the hype, and get an understanding about where and how you can use it in your own organisations.",

Program will reach its 20th school by June 2017 (around 500 girls and 50 teachers).\n\n--------------------\n\nTalk 2: Herding cats is easy compared to managing developers - Dom Millar\n\nA short and sharp guide to managing developers.\n\n--------------------\n\nTalk 3: F# Without Windows - Mitchell Tilbrook\n\nRight so you've picked F# as the language for your next project outstanding, but only one problem, you don't have Windows, so no Visual Studio. The good news you don't need it. In this lightning talk, we will setup, compile and run a F# program using nothing more than a text editor and .NETCore\n\n--------------------\n\nTalk 4: Site Reliability 101 - Simple techniques you can use to make your website more resilient to failure - Adrian Ubalde\n\nDomain.com.au, one of Australia’s most visited websites, is built with the expectation that things can and will go wrong in production. Here are two simple techniques that are used to help stop small production failures from turning into disasters.\n\n--------------------\n\nTalk 5: Create a Consistent, Repeatable and Dependable DevOps process using FAKE - Has AlTaiar\n\nA corner stone of any solution is its build and release process. In this talk, I will demo why developers should use FAKE to build their DevOps process. \n\nThere are many build / CI servers out there, and there are even more options for scripting something. However, coming up with something that can be adopted by everybody in the team, easy to use, and dependable, can be challenging. FAKE makes this a lot easier, especially when you have different environments, varying build agents (Windows/Mac/Linux), and multiple challenging build steps.

For developers, React Native supports live reload and hot reload, allowing you to immediately see the changes you have made to your app without lengthy recompilation and redeployment. What's more, React Native supports live updates, allowing your app to be dynamically updated without republishing to the AppStore or Google Play.\n\nIn this session, you will learn how to use React Native to build iOS apps. You will see how to start building your iOS app within minutes and understand how live reload, hot load, and live updates work.",

And in many cases, types can even be used to encode business rules so that you literally cannot create incorrect code. You can then use the static type checking almost as an instant unit test — making sure that your code is correct at compile time.\n\nIn this talk, we'll look at some of the ways you can use types as part of a domain driven design process, with some simple real world examples in F#.

          "abstract": "React Native allows developers to create native cross-platform using JavaScript, or really anything that will compile to JS C#, TypeScript, or even F#. But why would you use React Native? How run-time typed language like JavaScript be a better choice for developing apps than say, Swift, Java, Kotlin, C# ( Xamarin ) or C++ all compile time static type checked languages. Firstly is just that, there is no need for a compile step, React Native can update the JS without having to reload compile and replace the previous application. Compiling an app everytime can take a long time for a small project this might be 1-5min, but larger apps can easily take as long as 45 minutes or more to build a single app. \n\nIn this talk, we will explore how features like hot code reloading allow for much faster edit and run cycles, how you can use tools like Flow or TypeScript to add type safety without incurring the long compile times found in more native methods. To Prove the how simple and fast React Native is to builds apps we will create a simple app live on stage. To top it all off, you can even embed React into existing Native Apps, avoiding the need for a total rewrite.",

At Domain.com.au in Australia, we used these principles to recover from catastrophic data failures in our clickstream events, and in this session, I'll show you how we did it.

Well there are two big reasons: first of all: If people with an intellectual disability can use your app, they can get info about their life-situation and that empowers quality of life. Smartphones by example uses Text-To-Speech and principal the need to “can read” isn’t there anymore. \n\nFor you as developer or startup there’s also a big benefit of apps for these people: nearly every market is discovered for mobile apps. Every market has big concurrency. But the market of apps for people with a disability is quite less discovered, so if you are good, you can rule a hole market!",

A quick walk through of and a pointer to the sample code so you can adapt the technique for your own evil purposes.\n\n--------------------\n\nTalk 2: Adventure in learning Go for a C# dev! - Ken Faulkner\n\nIn this lightning talk I'll be going through some of the challenges, gotchas, WTFs and FTWs that I've experienced while starting to develop in Go (on Windows). Although traditionally a .NET/C# dev, I thought I should make an attempt to learn something new. Go is cool and shiny, so I thought I'd combine my love of all things Azure with the new \"shiny shiny\".\n\n--------------------\n\nTalk 3: Learning effective Kanban from your coffee shop - Dom Raniszewski\n\nDo you know that your favorite cafe is following Kanban possibly even without knowing about it. I'm going to explain how they manage their flow and keep work in progress limits in check using very simple yet effective methods.\n\n--------------------\n\nTalk 4: Designing interfaces that don't suck when your customers scale! - Rob Pearson\n\nCustomers come in all shapes and sizes. Some will use your products exactly as you intend while others will go way beyond your expectations. This is perfectly normal, possibly the price of success, but it can result in all kinds of problems that you didn't expect. Problems can range from terrible performance to usability issues where the user interface becomes useless. It can be surprising when a dashboard that looks great for ten records can be completely unusable when it displays a thousand records. This can be far more frustrating than a page that is simply slow to load.\n\nOctopus Deploy, a friendly .NET deployment automation tool, has to contend with this problem. Some customers have a single project, and some have thousands. It's a challenge designing for everyone. This session is all about thinking about scale when building and designing the user interface of your apps and web sites. We’ll review the lessons learned from growing Octopus Deploy and offer actionable tips that you can apply on the projects you're building right now. Techniques and patterns to display empty state, one thing, some things and too many things. This is still a work in progress so you'll see the good, the bad and the ugly. The goal of this presentation is to help you design your apps so they work great for all your customers.\n\n--------------------\n\nTalk 5: Beyond Chatops: Bots @ Domain - Paul McManus\n\nBots have grown in popularilty, but their utility to consumers is questionable. Where bots are extremely useful to are to technical teams. The tech team at Domain have written dozens of bots to automate and improve workflows around many, many of our internal tasks. We have started to look out our chat tools as a shared, transparent and pretty command line interface. In this talk I'll cover a range of examples and provide inspiration to go back to your work and start building some bots of your own.\n\n--------------------\n\nTalk 6: Designing Voice User Interfaces for Amazon Alexa - Fabien Ruffin\n\nVoice assistants have started to take over our lives in recent years, from Siri, Google and Cortana on mobile devices to Amazon Alexa in the centre of our homes.\n\nIn this talk you will learn how to design great voice user interfaces that will make your voice assistants feel like a friend more than a robot to your users.",

REST, as specified in Roy Fielding’s seminal dissertation, has become the architectural pattern of choice for APIs and when applied correctly allows for clients and servers to evolve in a loosely coupled manner. There are areas however where REST can deliver less than ideal client experiences. Often many HTTP requests are required to render a single view.\n\nWhile this may be a minor concern for a web app running on a WAN with low latency and high bandwidth, it can yield poor client experiences for mobile clients in particular. GraphQL is Facebook’s response to this challenge and it is quickly proving itself as an exciting alternative to RESTful APIs for a wide range of contexts. GraphQL is a query language that provides a clean and simple syntax for consumers to interrogate your APIs. These queries are strongly types, hierarchical and enable clients to retrieve only the data they need.\n\nIn this session, we will take a hands-on look at GraphQL and see how it can be used to build APIs that are a joy to use.",

Conversely, a functional approach, in which logic and side effects are clearly separated, leads to more testable and reliable programs. \n\nThe talk will firstly explain exactly what side effects are - there are various types. Then, for each type of side effect, code samples will be shown, and techniques will be explained for refactoring standard idioms to a more functional style, where side effects and logic are isolated.",
